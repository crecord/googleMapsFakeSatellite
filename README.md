Description
-----------

This is a web project that takes in audio and GPS that was recorded simultaneously and plays it back as a fake satellite video via a google maps mod.    

Features:
- Moves the frame of google maps to follow along with the gps points in sync with the play back of the audio
- Rotates the frame of the maps toward whatever direction the gps points are headed 

Note: that the file must be on a server otherwise the XML file cannot be read in. Only tested in Chrome.
